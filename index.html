            <p>" I was EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've succesfully switched careers, woorking as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

I was encourgared to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait for long assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was out standing. It look my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referrend to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended "</p>
